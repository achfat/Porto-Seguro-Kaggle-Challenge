# Porto-Seguro-Kaggle-Challenge

In this competition, you will predict the probability that an auto insurance policy holder files a claim. In the train and test data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names (e.g., ind , reg, car, calc). 

In addition, feature names include the postfix bin to indicate binary features and cat to indicate categorical features. Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal. 

Values of -1 indicate that the feature was missing from the observation. 

The target columns signifies whether or not a claim was filed for that policy holder.
